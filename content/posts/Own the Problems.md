Here's some unsolicited advice to my fellow software engineers grinding to climb the technical ladder. You may not agree with all of it, but I still invite you to reflect.

## It's Your Problem

I've seen way too many people getting caught complaining that the PM didn't write proper Jira tickets before sprint planning. Or that our node version is too old. Or that standup meetings were taking too long. Or that people don't write tests...

At some point you'll sound like a dark rain cloud and this will prevent you from being considered for exciting new opportunities because complaining is the easy route. You must be part of the solution. There are probably already 10 other people pointing to the problems.
