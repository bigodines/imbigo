Here's some unsolicited advice to my fellow software engineers grinding to climb the technical ladder. You may not agree with all of it, but I still invite you to reflect.

## Outstanding Performance Required

You won't get promoted for doing expected work. Promotions need to be justified - your manager has to have enough evidence to fight for your case. To be promoted your performance must be outstanding.

Sorry to break your heart but the good CTOs, directors+, and staff+ I know worked their asses off, especially in the early days (most still don't do 9-5s).

## Brag About Your Work

Keep a Brag Book or notes to build a strong case at the end of the year. But also make sure no one is surprised to hear about what you've done. Your work needs to show off.
