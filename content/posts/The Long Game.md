## Stay Focused and Be Patient

Career is not a race. To advance it requires a lot of experience acquired through sweat and tears. There is also a lot of luck involved - right company, right team, right projects, right time interviewing, etc.

The beauty of it is that it usually works out in the end. I turned 40 this year and when I look through my connections from 15 or 20 years ago, they are all doing very well in life. Some hit the jackpot and retired and the rest are working in great companies or having a lot of fun building their own companies (some happier than others in doing so :D).
