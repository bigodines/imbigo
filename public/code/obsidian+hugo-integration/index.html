            <h2 id="the-challenge-website-in-an-evening">The Challenge: Website in an Evening</h2>
<p>I had a Sunday evening free and decided to see how far I could get building a personal website with an AI agent&rsquo;s help. The goal wasn&rsquo;t just to throw together a basic site, but to create something I&rsquo;d actually want to use - complete with a custom theme, content management, and proper deployment.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: you&rsquo;re reading this on that very website.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-wanted">What I Wanted</h2>
<p>My requirements were pretty specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal blog/portfolio site using Hugo. This would allow me to host for free as a GitHub page and would make it blazing fast and highly cacheable</li>
<li>Three different page types: blog posts, an about page, and a place to keep my open source code categorized</li>
<li>Content management through Obsidian (since I already live in it for notes)</li>
<li>Something that looks modern but doesn&rsquo;t take forever to load</li>
<li>Custom domain with automated deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>I started with <code>hugo new site imbigo</code>, opened VSCode, and basically told the AI what I wanted:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;I just started this project using Hugo v0.147.5. In a brand new git repository. My plan is for us to code a personal website/blog for me using Hugo and eventually manage the content from my Obsidian notes. I would like for you to get familiar with the files in this directory and for us to start working on a theme for my future website.

My website will have three types of pages: the main page is going to be a blog with my latest articles, I also want an &#34;about me&#34; page with a large picture on the right side and some text on the left where I will briefly describe my professional path. I would also like a different page layout for a &#34;code&#34; section where I will showcase open source projects I&#39;ve built.

In terms of the style of the website, I am looking for something modern but lightweight. Should we give it a try?&#34;
</code></pre><h2 id="how-it-actually-went">How It Actually Went</h2>
<h3 id="getting-the-theme-right-1-prompt">Getting the Theme Right (1 prompt)</h3>
<p>The AI immediately got to work on a custom theme called <code>imbigo-theme</code>. I was honestly surprised at how well it understood Hugo&rsquo;s structure right away. It created:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete theme with all the Hugo conventions</li>
<li>Responsive layouts for all three page types</li>
<li>Clean HTML with proper Hugo templating</li>
<li>CSS with flexbox that actually worked on mobile</li>
<li>Some basic JavaScript for navigation</li>
<li>Slop placeholder texts</li>
</ul>
<p>The crazy part? It all worked on the first try. No broken layouts, no debugging - just a working website.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-content-part-of-initial-prompt">Setting Up Content (part of initial prompt)</h3>
<p>Next was organizing the content structure. The AI set up all the directories properly and created some sample posts to show how each page type would work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog posts in <code>/content/posts/</code></li>
<li>Project showcases in <code>/content/code/</code></li>
<li>Static pages like the about page</li>
<li>Front matter templates for each type</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing groundbreaking here, but it saved me from having to remember Hugo&rsquo;s conventions.</p>
<h3 id="logo-tweaking-3-prompts">Logo Tweaking (3 prompts)</h3>
<p>I had created a logo using DALL-E  and wanted to use it instead of just text. The AI swapped it in easily, but then came the fun part - getting the sizing right. &ldquo;The logo is too big,&rdquo; I said. Fixed. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s too small.&rdquo; Fixed again. This back-and-forth actually worked really well. I would have helped if I knew the size and where I wanted from the get go but I didn&rsquo;t so we were brute forcing until it looked good enough.</p>
<h3 id="the-obsidian-integration-1-prompt">The Obsidian Integration (1 prompt)</h3>
<p>This is where things got interesting. I explained that I wanted to write everything in Obsidian and have it sync to the website. The AI didn&rsquo;t just help with templates - it built me a complete solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian templates for each content type with the right Hugo front matter</li>
<li>A bash script (<code>sync-obsidian.sh</code>) that syncs my vault to Hugo&rsquo;s content directory</li>
<li>Validation to make sure nothing breaks during sync</li>
<li>A help system because why not</li>
</ul>
<p>The script actually works great and handles edge cases I didn&rsquo;t even think about.</p>
<h3 id="getting-it-online-1-prompt">Getting It Online (1 prompt)</h3>
<p>The last piece was deployment. I explained I wanted free hosting on GitHub with a custom domain, and the AI walked me through setting up:</p>
<ul>
<li>A GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds</li>
<li>GitHub Pages configuration</li>
<li>DNS setup for my custom domain</li>
<li>Some Hugo optimizations for production</li>
</ul>
<p>Now whenever I push to main, the site rebuilds automatically.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ended-up-with">What I Ended Up With</h2>
<p>After about 6 main prompts (plus a few small adjustments), I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom Hugo theme that actually looks decent</li>
<li>Three different page layouts that work on mobile</li>
<li>Obsidian integration with automated syncing</li>
<li>A deployment pipeline that runs on GitHub Actions</li>
<li>Custom domain setup (imbigo.net)</li>
<li>Google Analytics integration</li>
<li>Documentation and templates for everything</li>
</ul>
<p>Total prompts: <del>6 for major features + 3-4 for tweaks
Total cost: Claude subscription + domain (</del>$20/year)
Hosting: Free on GitHub Pages
Domain: (I forgot :D)
Time to write a new post: Write in Obsidian, run sync script, done</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>A few things that stood out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The AI understood the whole pipeline, not just individual pieces</li>
<li>Small iterative changes worked really well</li>
<li>It provided good documentation without being asked</li>
<li>It followed Hugo conventions I didn&rsquo;t even know existed</li>
<li>It anticipated problems I would have run into later</li>
</ol>
<p>Six prompts for a complete website with CMS and deployment. That&rsquo;s pretty remarkable when you think about it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about trying AI-assisted development: be specific about what you want and expect to iterate. I&rsquo;m not here to tell you how to do it or to sell a course on how to build the perfect prompt but I&rsquo;m here to encourage to give it a honest try. The technology is surprisingly capable right now and only getting better every week.</p>
