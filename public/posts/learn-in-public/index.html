            <p>Here&rsquo;s is the first in a series of unsolicited advice to my fellow software engineers grinding to climb the technical ladder. You may not agree with all of them, but I still invite you to reflect.</p>
<p><strong>Learn in Public</strong></p>
<p>Contribute to open source projects, join <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaggle</a> competitions, be active in a programming community. Find ways to work on fun real life problems and build a portfolio along the way.</p>
<p>Learning in public does three things simultaneously: it builds your skills working in a complex project/problem instead of tutorial hell, it creates tangible proof of your abilities that goes way beyond a resume, and it puts you in rooms (virtual or otherwise) with people who can change your career trajectory. When you contribute to open source, you&rsquo;re getting code reviews from maintainers who might work at your dream company. And unlike grinding LeetCode in private, everything you do in public compounds - a GitHub contribution from three years ago can still land in a hiring manager&rsquo;s search today. The portfolio you build isn&rsquo;t just code, it&rsquo;s proof you can collaborate, communicate, and ship. Bonus points: You are also making the software engineering world a better place for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="heres-a-personal-story">Here&rsquo;s a personal story</h3>
<p>I was lucky to be involved in the early days of <a href="https://www.joomla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joomla!</a>, when it was called mamboserver and back when documentation sucked so I spent a good chunk of my day reading and writing forum posts. I eventually wrote some tutorials, built a community in Brazil and made lifelong friends throughout the process. That catapulted me to markets way beyond the small agency in the countryside of Brazil where I was building websites at the time. Had I not done that, it would have taken me twice as long to get to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>If I were a junior engineer today, I would get involved in an open source project and start writing tests or fixing bugs reported by other users. Free mentorship from top-notch engineers, hands-on experience with a popular product used at scale—it&rsquo;s all there. As a hiring manager looking through 2000 resumes with the same 3 projects (Instagram clone, Spotify clone, movie recommender) versus a resume that reads &ldquo;I just graduated, but here are 5 meaningful contributions to Obsidian/Hugo/Kubernetes/Chromium/Go/Python/etc.&quot;—which one do you think stands out?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all admit we (currently) suck and not be afraid to learn in public.</p>
